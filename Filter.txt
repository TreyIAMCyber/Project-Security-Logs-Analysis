# Wireshark Log Analysis - Common Filters Used  

# Basic IP Filtering
ip.addr == x.x.x.x          # Show all packets involving a specific IP  
ip.src == x.x.x.x           # Show packets where x.x.x.x is the source  
ip.dst == x.x.x.x           # Show packets where x.x.x.x is the destination  

# HTTP Traffic Filtering
http.request                # Show all HTTP requests  
http.host contains "example.com"  # Filter packets related to a specific domain  
tcp.port == 80              # Display only HTTP traffic  

# HTTPS (TLS) Filtering
tls.handshake.type == 1     # Show TLS client hello packets  
tcp.port == 443             # Display only HTTPS traffic  

# DNS Traffic
dns                         # Show all DNS queries and responses  
dns.qry.name contains "example.com"  # Show DNS queries related to a specific domain  

# Suspicious Activity Indicators
tcp.flags.syn == 1          # Show TCP SYN packets (potential scans)  
icmp                        # Display ICMP packets (ping, traceroute behavior)  
udp.port == 53              # Show DNS traffic via UDP  
ftp                         # Display FTP traffic (can indicate insecure file transfers)  

# Miscellaneous & Debugging
frame contains "keyword"    # Search packets that contain a specific string  
tcp.stream eq X             # Isolate packets in a specific TCP conversation
